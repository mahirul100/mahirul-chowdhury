    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I reside in the northwest suburbs near Chicago, IL. With over 20 years as a Project Management Professional specializing in various domains such as Information Technology, Retail, and Financial Investment, I have worked with Fortune 50 companies and contributed during the COVID-19 pandemic. I hold an MBA in Business Administration with a focus on Project Management and have been a certified Project Management Professional since 2010.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I'm developing a sustainable individual financial investment platform aimed at benefiting humanity, focusing on charity and donations. I'm also working on a book addressing world politics and brainstorming a play that humorously depicts common immigrant stories in the U.S., set for production in mid to late 2025.

    <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I am passionate about lifelong learning, especially in project management and emerging technologies. Astronomy fascinates me; I love stargazing and pondering theories about the universe. 
        Additionally, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and exploring nature, along with cooking and appreciating diverse cuisines. Music is another passion, especially jazz, blues, and folk, and I love attending opera and musical performances.
